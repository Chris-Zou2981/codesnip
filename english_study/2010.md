Basic Concepts
The jsPlumb Toolkit is a data binding and rendering wrapper around the open source jsPlumb Community edition library. At its core is the concept of a graph, representing the entities and relationships in your data model. Each instance of the Toolkit manages a single data model (a single graph), and can be rendered to zero or more UI elements. Each of these renderers is assigned its own instance of jsPlumb.
